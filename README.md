  <h4 align="center">An Modcharting backend library for Friday Night Funkin' made by modders, to modders.</h4>
</p>

**FunkinModchart** is a tool designed to bring [NotITG](https://www.noti.tg/) visuals and capabilities to [Friday Night Funkin](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin), adding modifiers to change the **arrow trajectory, colors, transparency and the  rotation angle through 3D Axes**, event system to change the modifier's percent easing or setting those to create endless amazing visual effects and even **more**!.

This framework also provides **extra features** that can help you to make even more crazy visuals, as **arrow paths, 3D view camera, AFTs**, etc. *(If you have already modeled NotITG or StepMania, you know what I am talking about)*

<summary><h2>Importing the library</h2></summary>

This library currently has support for multiple engines such as [Codename Engine](https://codename-engine.com), [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine.com) and [FPS Plus](https://github.com/ThatRozebudDude/FPS-Plus-Public) click [here](SUPPORT.md) for more information, and only takes a couple of lines of code to import it:

#### Go to your project and open `Project.xml`
At the bottom of where the haxelib section is, paste this code.
```xml
<haxedef name="FM_ENGINE" value="YOUR_ENGINE"/>
<haxedef name="FM_ENGINE_VERSION" value="ENGINE_VERSION"/>

<haxelib name="funkin-modchart" />
<haxeflag name="--macro" value="modchart.core.macros.Macro.includeFiles()"/>
```

Fill in the definitions with your engine name and version using the [format](SUPPORT.md) mentioned.

And if you did everything good, it should compile and work normal !

<summary><h2>Using the library</h2></summary>

This is the easiest thing, you only have to do a couple of steps for add the modchart instance to a song.

#### Import `modchart.Manager`
And then make an instance of it, and add it to the state.

```haxe
var funkin_modchart_instance:Manager = new Manager();
// On your create function.
add(funkin_modchart_instance);
```

This can be done via haxe scripts or source code, and will soon be possible in PsychLua for `PSYCH` as well.

Make sure that at the time you create the instance, the notes and strums were already generated.
This now all the stuff should be working, do your stuff now.

#### Making a Modchart
First, you should know all the modcharting functions, check they [here](DOC.md).
To make a modchart you don't necessarily have to follow instructions, it's a matter of experimenting with the modifiers and all the functions that FunkinModchart offers, although previous experience with The Mirin Template and NotITG would help you design a good modchart more easily.
