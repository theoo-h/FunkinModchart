### Event Manager
- [X] Fix ease and set overlapping

### ModifierGroup
- [ ] Optimize percent management system as much as it can

### ModchartGraphics
- [ ] Make the `visible` property being used (sprite.exists | alive)
- [ ] Fix proxy renderer

### ModchartEnvironment (new class)
- [ ] Concept: Be able to use function formats from other frameworks (such as Andromeda's ModManager/Troll Engine or Zoro's Modcharting Tools or even the Mirin Template (maybe)). This would make it easier to port modcharts already made for those frameworks to FunkinModchart, or also for those who are already familiar with those frameworks and would like to make a modchart in FunkinModchart.
